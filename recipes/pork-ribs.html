                <h1>Pork Ribs</h1>

                <h3>Ribs?</h3>
                <p>
                    Ribs are a great addition to a BBQ or even hold up on their own. They are relatively easy to smoke with great results.
                    The goal is to have ribs with a firm coating and soft inside.
                    <br>
                    Ribs are a great first smoke if you are new to smoking and BBQ as they take a shorter period of time compared to brisket. Ribs usually take between 3-5 hours to cook. They are quicker than brisket as the rib bones heat and essentially cook the ribs from the inside out.
                </p>

                <h3>Choosing Ribs</h3>
                <p>
                    Pork baby back ribs are great for smoking as they are high in flavour and hold moisture well. Baby back ribs can be bought from most supermarkets or butchers. You can also be purchased online which opens up a broader range and higher quality.
                </p>

                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <h4>Ribs</h4>
                <p>
                    Once you have chosen your ribs, on a clean work surface lay them with the curve of the rib bones facing down so you are looking at the underside of the rack of ribs. With a sharp knife, score and peel the thin, translucent layer of skin off of the underside of the rack. We want to remove this layer as it is tough and not great for eating.
                    <br>
                    Once the ribs have been trimmed of the skin, coat them in a dry rub this will help firm up the outside of the ribs and keep the inside juicy. <span><a href="porkrib-dry-rub.html">See my pork dry rub here</a></span> This ideally needs to be done the night before so they can on take the flavour of the rub.
                </p>
                <h4>Smoker</h4>
                <p>
                    Smoking ribs will usually take 3-5hours so start a suitable time before you are planning to eat the ribs.
                    <br>
                    If this is your first time using a smoker, it should be clean and ready for use, if not, make sure that the charcoal basket is clear from charcoal dust and the smoker is relatively clean from your last smoke. We need good air circulation round the smoker.
                    <br>
                    Once the smoker is clean fill the charcoal basket with charcoal briquettes (briquettes over lumpwood charcoal as these tend to light quicker).
                    If you have a charcoal igniter, then igniting the charcoal will be easy. Load the igniter with charcoal. And then heat over a flame. Once the charcoal is fully white empty it into the full charcoal basket. This should be enough to get the rest of the charcoal to ignite. If not, try putting some firelighters around the charcoal basket to assist in igniting.
                    <br>
                    The optimal temperature for smoking a ribs is between 200F and 225F <span>See the temperature converter if needed.</span> This will need to be maintained for the duration of the cook. The internal temperature of your smoker can be adjusted using the airflow valves, open for more oxygen resulting in more heat, and the exhaust valve these will usually be left fully open to help exhaust the smoke and Co2 quickly.
                    <br>
                    After 10-15 minutes the smoker should be at a suitable temperature to cook (between 200F and 225F).
                </p>

                <h3>The Cook</h3>
                <h4>Start</h4>
                <p>
                    Open the lid to your smoker and lay the ribs facing up onto the grill. If you have an external cooking temperature probes push this into the middle of the meat between two rib bones with the wire to the temperature gage hanging outside of the smoker. Close the lid to the smoker firmly, you may have lost some internal temperature while doing this, but that heat will build back up quickly.
                    <br>
                    You can add some wood lumps or chips now to start adding some smoke, Apple is a good choice when smoking pork.
                    <br>
                    Monitor the internal temperature of the smoker and the internal temperature of the ribs frequently.
                    If the internal temperature of the smoker begins to reduce either adjust the airflow valves or add more charcoal to the basket.
                    If the smoker stops producing smoke, you can add more wood, the more wood you add the smokier the flavour.
                </p>
                <h4>Middle</h4>
                <p>
                    Once the ribs get between 80F and 150F it's a good addition to start brushing on a BBQ sauce to the ribs this will keep the ribs juicy and the sauce will caramelize on top of the ribs. Best results with brushing every 30 to 45 minutes.<span><a href="whiskey-bbq-sauce.html">See my whiskey BBQ sauce here</a></span>
                    <br>
                    Just keep maintaining heat between 200F and 225F. Adding wood for smoke where required.
                </p>

                <h4>End</h4>
                <p>
                    Once the internal temperature of the ribs has reached between 200F and 215F it is ready to remove from the smoker. Once removed, let the ribs rest for anywhere up to 30 minutes before carving.  
                    <br>
                    The Ribs should carve apart easily and have a firm exterior texture with a soft inside. The ribs should be sticky and sweet from the BBQ sauce. There should be a slight red/pink smoke ring around the edge of the ribs.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Enjoy.</h4>
