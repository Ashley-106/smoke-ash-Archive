                <h1>Beef Brisket</h1>

                <h3>Brisket?</h3>
                <p>
                    Brisket is the king of BBQ meats, it is easy to get wrong, resulting in either being too dry, too smoky or burnt.
                    The goal is to have a brisket, which is sufficiently smoky in flavour, but still juicy when cut. And with a bark on the outside usually more on the bottom as this is exposed to the majority of the heat and smoke.
                    It can take a few attempts to really get used to cooking brisket.
                    <br>
                     It needs to be monitored throughout the cooking duration to either maintain heat within the smoker, add wood to increase smoke or to spray the brisket to stop it drying out. The smoking process usually takes between 6-12 hours depending on the size of the brisket.
                </p>

                <h3>Choosing a Brisket</h3>
                <p>
                    Firstly, you need the right brisket. Being a predominantly American meat choice for BBQ and Smoking it is inevitably slightly harder to find over here.
                    A browse of the local supermarket will turn up joints labelled "Brisket Roasting Joint" these are not suitable for smoking and will not remain juicy after hours of smoking. The reason these are not suitable is because they have the majority of the fat removed and are usually rolled and tied for easy roasting in an oven.
                    <br>
                    There are two options for getting a good brisket for smoking. The first is going to a butchers directly, phone first as some only stock the before mentioned roasting joint briskets. You are looking for a long flat brisket with a fat cap along the whole top. Ideally a brisket, which has not been trimmed as you can do this at home.
                    <br>
                    Secondly, find a suitable website which stocks brisket for BBQ and smoking. This is usually easier and opens up more choice of brisket and quality.
                </p>

                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <h4>Brisket</h4>
                <p>
                    Once a suitable brisket has been chosen, we need to prepare for smoking. This is best done the night before you plan to smoke the brisket.
                    <br>
                    Lay the brisket on a clean work surface and trim any large, thick areas of fat, we still want to keep a minimum of 1cm of fat all over the top of the brisket (if possible). A layer of fat this thick will render down into the meat and help keep the brisket juicy, anything over 1cm (roughly) will not render down and will remain on the top of the brisket.
                    <br>
                    Once the brisket has been suitably trimmed, we need to apply a rub to enhance the flavour and to aid in establishing a bark on the outside of the brisket. <span><a href="brisket-dry-rub.html">See my brisket dry rub here</a></span>
                </p>
                <h4>Smoker</h4>
                <p>
                    Knowing that a brisket can take between 6-12 hours it is advisable to start the cook as early as possible on the day of smoking. 
                    <br>
                    If this is your first time using a smoker, it should be clean and ready for use, if not, make sure that the charcoal basket is clear from charcoal dust and the smoker is relatively clean from your last smoke. We need good air circulation round the smoker.
                    <br>
                    Once the smoker is clean fill the charcoal basket with charcoal briquettes (briquettes over lumpwood charcoal as these tend to light quicker).
                    If you have a charcoal igniter, then igniting the charcoal will be easy. Load the igniter with charcoal. And then heat over a flame. Once the charcoal is fully white empty it into the full charcoal basket. This should be enough to get the rest of the charcoal to ignite. If not, try putting some firelighters around the charcoal basket to assist in igniting.
                    <br>
                    The optimal temperature for smoking a brisket is between 200F and 225F <span>See the temperature converter if needed.</span> This will need to be maintained for the duration of the cook. The internal temperature of your smoker can be adjusted using the airflow valves, open for more oxygen resulting in more heat, and the exhaust valve these will usually be left fully open to help exhaust the smoke and Co2 quickly.
                    <br>
                    After 10-15 minutes the smoker should be at a suitable temperature to cook (between 200F and 225F).
                </p>

                <h3>The Cook</h3>
                <h4>Start</h4>
                <p>
                    Open the lid to your smoker and lay the brisket fat cap side facing up onto the grill. If you have an external cooking temperature probes push this into the middle of the brisket with the wire to the temperature gage hanging outside of the smoker. Close the lid to the smoker firmly, you may have lost some internal temperature while doing this, but that heat will build back up quickly.
                    <br>
                    You can add some wood lumps or chips now to start adding some smoke, Oak is a good choice when smoking beef.
                    <br>
                    Monitor the internal temperature of the smoker and the internal temperature of the brisket frequently.
                    If the internal temperature of the smoker begins to reduce either adjust the airflow valves or add more charcoal to the basket.
                    If the smoker stops producing smoke, you can add more wood, the more wood you add the smokier the flavour.
                </p>
                <h4>Middle</h4>
                <p>
                    Once the brisket gets between 80F and 150F its advisable to start spraying it with cider using a spray bottle for easy application, spraying every 45mintues to an hour. We want to do this to avoid the brisket drying out from the heat and smoke.
                    <br>
                    Just keep maintaining heat between 200F and 225F. Adding wood for smoke where required.
                </p>
                <h4>The Stall</h4>
                <p>
                    Once the brisket reaches internal temperature of around 160F to 180F depending on the fat content and size the stall begins. This is when the connective tissue within the brisket starts to break and render down, This is the process which results in the brisket becoming soft and juicy.
                    During the stall you will see that the internal temperature of the brisket does not rise as it did before hence "the stall". This is normal and can take from an hour to a few hours depending on size and fat content.
                    <br>
                    Continue to monitor regularly and spray with cider.
                    <br>
                    Once the internal temperature of the brisket begins to rise again, it is advisable to remove the brisket from the smoker and wrap in tin foil to keep moisture in from the stall, at this point the brisket should have gained a good bark on the outside so removing it from direct contact with the smoke will not be an issue.
                    Wrap the brisket and place it back into the smoker. Still, while maintaining the heat. If wrapped you do not need to add any more wood as the smoke will not be flavouring the meat.
                </p>

                <h4>End</h4>
                <p>
                    Once the internal temperature of the brisket has reached between 200F and 215F it is ready to remove from the smoker. Once removed, remove from the tin foil wrap and let the brisket rest for anywhere up to 30 minutes before carving.  
                    <br>
                    The brisket should carve easily and have a soft texture with a slightly firmer bottom and should not be dry. There should be a red smoke ring around the edge of the sliced brisket being richer in colour depending on the amount of wood added during the cook.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Enjoy.</h4>
